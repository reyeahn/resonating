# MusicConnect: Next Development Steps

Based on the current state of the project, here's a detailed plan for implementing the Firebase backend and completing the core functionality.

## 1. Firebase Project Setup

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project named "MusicConnect"
   - Enable Google Analytics (optional but recommended)

2. **Configure Firebase Authentication**
   - In the Firebase console, go to Authentication → Sign-in method
   - Enable Email/Password authentication
   - Enable Google authentication
   - Add authorized domains (localhost for dev)

3. **Set Up Firestore Database**
   - In Firebase console, go to Firestore Database
   - Create database in test mode initially
   - Set up the following collections based on our schema:
     - `users`: User profiles and preferences
     - `posts`: Daily song posts
     - `matches`: User connections
     - `comments`: Post comments and interactions

4. **Configure Firebase Storage**
   - In Firebase console, go to Storage
   - Initialize Storage
   - Set up security rules for user uploads

5. **Add Firebase Config to Environment**
   - Go to Project Settings → General
   - Copy the Firebase SDK configuration
   - Create a `.env.local` file from `env.example`
   - Add the Firebase configuration values

## 2. Connect Frontend to Firebase

1. **Test Authentication**
   - Test SignupForm and LoginForm components
   - Verify OAuth integration with Google
   - Implement login status persistence

2. **Implement User Onboarding Flow**
   - Connect the onboarding questionnaire to Firestore
   - Save user music preferences to their profile
   - Create proper user redirects based on onboarding status

3. **Implement Song Posting**
   - Connect the post-song interface to Firestore
   - Save song posts with proper metadata
   - Implement "posted today" status tracking
   - Add validation to prevent multiple daily posts

4. **Implement Discover Page**
   - Pull real posts from Firestore instead of mock data
   - Implement matching logic based on music preferences
   - Save match data when users swipe right
   - Filter out already-viewed posts

## 3. Spotify API Integration

1. **Set Up Spotify Developer Account**
   - Create a Spotify Developer account
   - Register a new application
   - Add redirect URIs for authentication
   - Get client ID and secret

2. **Implement Spotify OAuth**
   - Create Spotify authentication endpoint
   - Handle Spotify callback and token storage
   - Add "Connect Spotify" button to user settings

3. **Implement Song Search**
   - Create Spotify search service
   - Implement song preview functionality
   - Store Spotify track metadata with posts

4. **Add Audio Features Analysis**
   - Use Spotify's audio features API for songs
   - Implement mood analysis based on audio features
   - Use these features for better matching algorithms

## 4. Deploy Basic Version

1. **Prepare for Deployment**
   - Ensure all environment variables are configured
   - Test application thoroughly
   - Set up proper security rules for Firestore and Storage

2. **Set Up Hosting**
   - Connect to Vercel or Netlify account
   - Configure build settings
   - Set up environment variables in hosting provider

3. **Deploy**
   - Deploy the application
   - Verify functionality in production environment
   - Set up proper domains and SSL

## Task Prioritization

1. **Priority 1 (Must have for MVP)**
   - Firebase project setup and configuration
   - Working authentication
   - Basic user profiles
   - Song posting functionality
   - Basic discovery feed

2. **Priority 2 (Important but can follow MVP)**
   - Spotify integration
   - Matching algorithm improvements
   - Comments and interactions
   - Profile customization

3. **Priority 3 (Nice to have)**
   - Advanced analytics
   - Push notifications
   - Friend connections
   - Shared playlists

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. Create Firebase project
2. Add real configuration to `.env.local`
3. Test authentication system 
4. Connect onboarding form to Firestore
5. Connect song posting to Firestore
